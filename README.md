# Introduction

This is a framework for building Robots, especially Telepresence Robots that can be accessed virtually.
You can control your robot through a virtual headset or a remote controller, like a video game.
Robots can also be controlled themselves with AI. This would be difficult, but not too impossible in the future.

This could be especially important when colonizing Mars.
Instead of humans going straight to Mars, Robots that we control can go there instead.
Better yet, AI-trained robots can colonize Mars for us!
Those robots would be very useful, making space-exploration available to anyone virtually!
Perhaps, these robots could colonize ANY PLANET, even the uninhabitable ones!
That means we could go ANYWHERE in the solar system!
The first step is building an Interplanetary Internet. That's the hardest part.
After that, virtual space exploration could be a possibility available to us as soon as 2030!

We're also going to build kids toys with this too!
We'll call it "MyRobot", and we'll give it features of Cloud-based AI training, LLM speech abilities, and even balance abilities.
I think this would be a very cool product for children, and I hope the ads on Cartoon Network show it too :).

Ok, maybe I'm getting a bit too off-guard here.
Personally, I'm using this to build my own personal Robot Buddy :).
You can use it to buid whatever you want, so have fun, build robots, and let's take hold of our futures!!
